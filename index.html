<h> Dwight Schrute Quotes <h> 
	<li><b>Speed Scale: </b>“I am fast. To give you a reference point I am somewhere between a snake and a mongoose… And a panther.”</li>
	<li><b>Friends: </b>“And I did not become a Lackawanna County volunteer sheriff’s deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven’t.”</li>
	<li><b>Superior Brain Power: </b>“Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.”</li>
	<li><b>A Long Line Of Fighters: </b>“I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran, killed twenty men, and spent the rest of the war in an Allied prison camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.”</li>
	<li><b>Attention</b>“You couldn’t handle my undivided attention.”</li>
	<li><b>Werewolf Hunting Experience</b>“I don’t have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once, but by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor’s dog.”</li>
	</ul>
